Baa baa black sheep
Have you any wool
Yes sir yes sir
Three bags full
One for my master
And one for my dame
And one for the little boy
That lives down the lane
A tisket a tasket
A green and yellow basket
I wrote a letter to my love
And on the way I dropped it
All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
Just my two front teeth
Gee if I could only have
My two front teeth
Then I could wish you Merry Christmas
Boom boom ain't it great to be crazy
Boom boom ain't it great to be crazy
Giddy and foolish all day long
Boom boom ain't it great to be crazy
Who can take a sunrise
Sprinkle it with dew
Cover it in chocolate
And a miracle or two
The candy man
The candy man can
The candy man can cause he
Mixes it with love and
Makes the world taste good
Who can take a rainbow
And wrap it in a sigh
Soak it in the sun and
Make a tasty lemon pie
The candy man
Oh the candy man can
The candy man can
Cause he mixes it with love
Makes the world taste good
The candy man makes everything he bakes
Satisfying and delicious
You could even eat the dishes
Who can take tomorrow
And dip it in a dream
Separate the sorrow
And collect up all the cream
The candy man
Oh the candy man can
The candy man can cause he
Mixes it with love and
Makes the world taste good
The candy man can cause he
Mixes it with love and
Makes the world taste good
Do your ears hang low
Do they wobble to and fro
Can you tie 'em in a knot
Can you tie 'em in a bow
Can you throw them over your shoulder
Like a continental soldier
Do your ears hang low
Tell me 'bout your legs
Are they short, are they thin
Are they tall or wide
If you're racin' will they win
Do they get you where you're goin'
Are they fast or are they slowin'
Tell me 'bout your legs
Have you got a tail
That is pretty or is plain
Is it curly or straight
Have you given it a name
Is it short or is it long
Is it weak or maybe strong
Have you got a tail
Do your ears hang high
Do they stand up in the sky
Do they drop down when they're wet
Do they stand up when they're dry
Do you wave them to your neighbor
With a minimum of labor
Do your ears hang high
Do you wave them to your neighbor
With a minimum of labor
Do your ears hang high
Do your ears hang high
Do your ears hang high
Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home 
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say
Did you ever see a baboon
Holding a balloon
Did you ever see a whale
With a polka-dot tail
Did you ever see a pig
Wearing a wig
Did you ever see a goat
Standing in a boat
Did you ever see a llama
Wearing pajamas
How much is that doggie
In the window
The one with the waggily tail
How much is that doggie 
In the window
I do hope that doggie is for sale
If you're happy and you know it
Clap you hands
If you're happy and you know it
Clap your hands
If you're happy and you know it
Then your face will surely show it
If you're happy and you know it
Clap you hands
London Bridge is falling down
Falling down, falling down
London Bridge is falling down 
My fair lady
She'll be comin' round the mountain
When she comes
She’ll be comin' round the mountain
When she comes
She'll be comin' round the mountain
When she comes
She'll be driving six white horses 
When she comes
When she comes
She'll be driving six white horses
She'll be driving six white horses
She'll be driving six white horses
When she comes
Oh we'll all go to meet her
When she comes
Oh we'll all go to meet her
When she comes
Oh we'll all go to meet her
Yes we'll all go to meet her
Yes we'll all go to meet her
When she comes
We'll be singing hallelujah
When she comes
We'll be singing hallelujah
When she comes
We'll be singing hallelujah
We'll be singing hallelujah
We'll be singing hallelujah
When she comes
She'll be comin' round the mountain 
When she comes
Lou Lou skip to my Lou

Take me out to the ball game
Take me out with the crowd
Buy me some peanuts and crackerjacks
I don't care if I never get back
Let me root root
For the home team
If they don't win it's a shame
Aahh for it's one two
Three strikes you're out
At the old ball game
All I need is just one chance
I could hit a home run
There isn't anyone else like me
Maybe I'll go down in history
And it's root root
For the home team
Here comes fortune and fame
'Cause I know that
I'll be the star
At the old ball game
The ants go marching one by one
Hurrah hurrah
The ants go marching one by one
Hurrah hurrah
The little one stops to chew his gym
And they all go marching
Down to the ground
To get out of the rain
Yes we have no bananas
We have no bananas today
We have string beans and onions
Cabbages and scallions
We have an old fashioned tomato
A Long Island potato
But yes we have no bananas
We have no bananas today
Yes we have no bananas
We have no bananas today
We have string beans and onions
Cabbages and scallions
We have an old fashioned tomato
A Long Island potato
But yes we have no bananas 
We have no bananas today
Repeat first and second verses
We have no bananas today
We have no bananas today
You’re a grand old flag
You’re a high flying flag
And forever in peace may you wave
You’re the emblem of
The land I love
The home of the free and the brave
Every heart beats true
‘Neath the red white and blue
Where there’s never a boast or brag
Should old acquaintance be forgot
Keep your eye on the grand old flag
The grand old flag
Do you know the muffin man

Hello I'm the muffin man

From the muffin man

Thank you mister muffin man 
Who lives on down the lane

Oh where oh 
Where
Has my little dog gone
Oh where 
Oh where can he be
With his ears cut short
And his tail cut long
Oh where oh 
Where can he be
I think he went down
To the building site
To see what he could see
And in his mouth
Was a globe so bright
I wonder what could it be
I last saw him by the bulldozer
Playing and running around
But I just can't see him there anymore
He just can't seem to be found
Perhaps the man over there will know
He may have seen him go by
Who knows where
He might have decided to go
But we've got to give it a try
Oh where 
Oh where
Has my little dog gone
Oh where where oh
Where can he be
With his tail cut long
Oh where oh 
Where can he be
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm being honest
It might have been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly
So I stepped off the golden
Nobody cried
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up I see
You with me
And you say
As long as I'm here
No one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here
But you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
They don't deserve you
I tried to scream
But my head was under water
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Could've been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up I see
You with me
And you say
As long as I'm here
No one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here
But you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
They don't deserve you
If I knew it all then would I do it again
Would I do it again
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead
If I knew it all then would I do it again
Would I do it again
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead
I've heard about this frog
It's very tiny frog
But it's also very special
You can only find it in the jungle
So far away from here
But if you find it
And if you touch it
Your world can change forever
If you touch its skin
You can feel your body changing
And your vision also
Blue becomes red
And red becomes blue
And your mommy suddenly becomes your daddy
And everything looks like a giant cupcake
And you keep laughing and laughing and laughing
Nothing is ever quite the same, really
And after you finished laughing
It's time to turn into a frog yourself
It's very funny to be a frog
You can dive into the water
And cross the rivers
And the oceans
And you can jump all the time and everywhere
Do you wanna play with me
We could be a whole group of friends
A whole group of frogs
Jumping into the streets
Jumping into the planet
Climbing the buildings
Swimming in the lakes and in the bathtubs
We would be hundreds thousands millions
The biggest group of friends the world has ever seen
Jumping and laughing forever
It would be great right
See all the colors in the sky
See all the colors in the sky
I tremble
They're gonna eat me alive
If I stumble
They're gonna eat me alive
Can you hear my heart
Beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer
Help I'm alive 
My heart keeps beating like a hammer 
Hard to be soft
Tough to be tender
Come take my pulse the pace is on a runaway train
Help I'm alive 
My heart keeps beating like a hammer 
Beating like a hammer 
If we're still alive
My regrets are few
If my life is mine
What shouldn't I do
I get wherever I'm going
I get whatever I need 
While my blood's still flowing
And my heart's still 
Beating like a hammer 
Beating like a hammer
Help I'm alive 
My heart keeps beating like a hammer
Hard to be soft 
Tough to be tender 
Come take my pulse the pace is on a runaway train
Help I'm alive 
My heart keeps beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer 
If we're still alive 
My regrets are few
If my life is mine
What shouldn't I do
I get wherever I'm going
I get whatever I need
While my blood's still flowing
And my heart's still
Beating like a hammer 
Help I'm alive
My heart keeps beating like a hammer
Did they tell you
You should grow up
When you wanted 
To dream
Did they warn you 
Better shape up
If you want to succeed
I don't know about you
Who are they talking to
They're not talking to me
I'm higher than high
Lower than deep
I'm doing it wrong
Singing along
Did I ask you 
For attention
When affection
Is what I need
Thinking sorrow
was perfection
I would wallow
Till you told me
There's no glitter in the gutter
There's no twilight galaxy
I'm higher than high
Lower than deep
I'm doing it wrong
Singing along
Go higher than high
Go lower than deep
Keep doing it wrong
Keep singing along
I'm alright now
Come on baby
I've seen all
The demons
That you've got
You're not alright now
Come on baby
I'll pick you up
And take you
Anywhere you want
Anything you want
Get hot
Get too close to the flame
Wild open space
Talk like an open book
Sign me up
Got no time to take a picture
I'll remember someday
All the chances we took
We're so close 
To something better left unknown
We're so close 
To something better left unknown
I can feel it in my bones
Gimme sympathy
After all of this is gone
Who would you rather be
The Beatles or The Rolling Stones
Oh seriously 
You're gonna make mistakes, you're young
Come on baby play me something 
Like here comes the sun
Come on baby play me something 
Like here comes the sun
Don't go stay with the all unknown
Stay away from the hooks
All the chances we took
We're so close 
To something better left unknown
We're so close 
To something better left unknown
I can feel it in my bones
Gimme sympathy
After all of this is gone
Who would you rather be
The Beatles or The Rolling Stones
Oh seriously 
You're gonna make mistakes you're young
Come on baby play me something 
Like here comes the sun
Come on baby play me something 
Like here comes the sun
I'm in the front row with a bottle
Don't know what I can't decide
I'm in the front row I'm a model
Don't know what I can't describe
Burnout stars they shine so bright
All of us 
Burnout stars they shine so bright
He's not perfect
He's my hero
Smashing the piano
Spitting on the front row
Chronic confrontation
Psychic conversation
Radical Compassion
Louder than the action of all of us
Burnout stars they shine so bright
All of us 
Burnout stars they shine so bright
All the stars
Burnout stars they shine so bright
All of us 
Burnout stars they shine so bright
I'm in the front row with a bottle
Don't know what I can't decide
I'm in the front row, I'm a model
Don't know what I can't describe
Burnout stars they shine so bright
All of us 
Burnout stars they shine so bright
He's not perfect
He's a victim of his occupation
Social Insulation
Secret Intervention 
Charge him with possession
I just want to watch him
Make a break and beat them all the stars
All the stars
Send us a blindfold, send us a blade
Tell the survivors help is on the way
I was a blindfold never complained
All the survivors singing in the rain
I was the one with the world at my feet
Got us a battle leave it up to me
Find us a trap door find us a plane
Tell the survivors help is on the way
I was a blindfold never complained
All the survivors singing in the rain
I was the one with the world at my feet
Got us a battle leave it up to me
What it is and where it stops nobody knows
You gave me a life I never chose
I wanna leave but the world won't let me go
I wanna leave but the world won't let me go
What it is and where it stops nobody knows
You gave me a life I never chose
I was the one with the world at my feet
Got us a battle leave it up to me
