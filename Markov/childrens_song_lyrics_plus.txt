Baa baa black sheep
Have you any wool
Yes sir yes sir
Three bags full
One for my master
And one for my dame
And one for the little boy
That lives down the lane
A tisket a tasket
A green and yellow basket
I wrote a letter to my love
And on the way I dropped it
All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
Just my two front teeth
Gee if I could only have
My two front teeth
Then I could wish you Merry Christmas
Boom boom ain't it great to be crazy
Boom boom ain't it great to be crazy
Giddy and foolish all day long
Boom boom ain't it great to be crazy
Who can take a sunrise
Sprinkle it with dew
Cover it in chocolate
And a miracle or two
The candy man
The candy man can
The candy man can cause he
Mixes it with love and
Makes the world taste good
Who can take a rainbow
And wrap it in a sigh
Soak it in the sun and
Make a tasty lemon pie
The candy man
Oh the candy man can
The candy man can
Cause he mixes it with love
Makes the world taste good
The candy man makes everything he bakes
Satisfying and delicious
You could even eat the dishes
Who can take tomorrow
And dip it in a dream
Separate the sorrow
And collect up all the cream
The candy man
Oh the candy man can
The candy man can cause he
Mixes it with love and
Makes the world taste good
The candy man can cause he
Mixes it with love and
Makes the world taste good
Do your ears hang low
Do they wobble to and fro
Can you tie 'em in a knot
Can you tie 'em in a bow
Can you throw them over your shoulder
Like a continental soldier
Do your ears hang low
Tell me 'bout your legs
Are they short, are they thin
Are they tall or wide
If you're racin' will they win
Do they get you where you're goin'
Are they fast or are they slowin'
Tell me 'bout your legs
Have you got a tail
That is pretty or is plain
Is it curly or straight
Have you given it a name
Is it short or is it long
Is it weak or maybe strong
Have you got a tail
Do your ears hang high
Do they stand up in the sky
Do they drop down when they're wet
Do they stand up when they're dry
Do you wave them to your neighbor
With a minimum of labor
Do your ears hang high
Do you wave them to your neighbor
With a minimum of labor
Do your ears hang high
Do your ears hang high
Do your ears hang high
Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home 
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say
Did you ever see a baboon
Holding a balloon
Did you ever see a whale
With a polka-dot tail
Did you ever see a pig
Wearing a wig
Did you ever see a goat
Standing in a boat
Did you ever see a llama
Wearing pajamas
How much is that doggie
In the window
The one with the waggily tail
How much is that doggie 
In the window
I do hope that doggie is for sale
If you're happy and you know it
Clap you hands
If you're happy and you know it
Clap your hands
If you're happy and you know it
Then your face will surely show it
If you're happy and you know it
Clap you hands
London Bridge is falling down
Falling down, falling down
London Bridge is falling down 
My fair lady
She'll be comin' round the mountain
When she comes
She’ll be comin' round the mountain
When she comes
She'll be comin' round the mountain
When she comes
She'll be driving six white horses 
When she comes
When she comes
She'll be driving six white horses
She'll be driving six white horses
She'll be driving six white horses
When she comes
Oh we'll all go to meet her
When she comes
Oh we'll all go to meet her
When she comes
Oh we'll all go to meet her
Yes we'll all go to meet her
Yes we'll all go to meet her
When she comes
We'll be singing hallelujah
When she comes
We'll be singing hallelujah
When she comes
We'll be singing hallelujah
We'll be singing hallelujah
We'll be singing hallelujah
When she comes
She'll be comin' round the mountain 
When she comes
Lou Lou skip to my Lou
Lou Lou skip to my Lou

Take me out to the ball game
Take me out with the crowd
Buy me some peanuts and crackerjacks
I don't care if I never get back
Let me root root
For the home team
If they don't win it's a shame
Aahh for it's one two
Three strikes you're out
At the old ball game
All I need is just one chance
I could hit a home run
There isn't anyone else like me
Maybe I'll go down in history
And it's root root
For the home team
Here comes fortune and fame
'Cause I know that
I'll be the star
At the old ball game
The ants go marching one by one
Hurrah hurrah
The ants go marching one by one
Hurrah hurrah
The little one stops to chew his gym
And they all go marching
Down to the ground
To get out of the rain
Yes we have no bananas
We have no bananas today
We have string beans and onions
Cabbages and scallions
We have an old fashioned tomato
A Long Island potato
But yes we have no bananas
We have no bananas today
Yes we have no bananas
We have no bananas today
We have string beans and onions
Cabbages and scallions
We have an old fashioned tomato
A Long Island potato
But yes we have no bananas 
We have no bananas today
Repeat first and second verses
We have no bananas today
We have no bananas today
You’re a grand old flag
You’re a high flying flag
And forever in peace may you wave
You’re the emblem of
The land I love
The home of the free and the brave
Every heart beats true
‘Neath the red white and blue
Where there’s never a boast or brag
Should old acquaintance be forgot
Keep your eye on the grand old flag
The grand old flag
Do you know the muffin man

Hello I'm the muffin man

From the muffin man

Thank you mister muffin man 
Who lives on down the lane
Who lives on down the lane
Oh where oh 
Where
Has my little dog gone
Oh where 
Oh where can he be
With his ears cut short
And his tail cut long
Oh where oh 
Where can he be
I think he went down
To the building site
To see what he could see
And in his mouth
Was a globe so bright
I wonder what could it be
I last saw him by the bulldozer
Playing and running around
But I just can't see him there anymore
He just can't seem to be found
Perhaps the man over there will know
He may have seen him go by
Who knows where
He might have decided to go
But we've got to give it a try
Oh where 
Oh where
Has my little dog gone
Oh where where oh
Where can he be
With his tail cut long
Oh where oh 
Where can he be
Now usually I don't do this but uh
Go head on and break 'em off wit a lil' preview of the remix
Now I'm not tryin' to be rude
But hey pretty girl I'm feelin' you
The way you do the things ya do
Reminds me of my Lexus coupe
That's why I'm all up in ya grill
Tryin' to get you to a hotel
You must be a football coach
The way you got me playin' the field
So baby gimme dat toot toot
And lemme give ya that beep beep
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro
Bouncin' on twenty fo's
While they sayin' on the radio
It's the remix to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin'
Sippin' on coke and rum rum
I'm like so what I'm drunk drunk
It's the freakin' weekend
Baby I'm about to have me some fun fun
Bounce bounce C'mon
Now it's like murda She wrote
Once I get cha out them clothes
Privacy is on the door
But still they can hear you screaming more
Girl I'm feelin' whatchu feelin'
No more hopin' and wishin'
I'm about to take my key and
Stick it in the ignition
So gimme dat toot toot
And lemme give ya that beep beep
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro
Bouncin' on twenty fo's
While they sayin' on the radio
It's the remix to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin'
Sippin' on coke and rum rum
I'm like so what I'm drunk drunk
It's the freakin' weekend
Baby I'm about to have me some fun fun
Cristal poppin' in the stretch Navigator
We got food everywhere, as if the party was catered
We've got fellas to my left left
Honies on my right right
We bring 'em both together we got jukin' all night
Then after the show it's the after party
And after the party it's the hotel lobby
Yeah around about four you gotta clear the lobby
Then take it to ya room and freak somebody
Can I get a toot toot
Can I get a beep beep
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro
Bouncin' on twenty fo's
While they sayin' on the radio
It's the remix to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin'
Sippin' on coke and rum rum
I'm like so what I'm drunk drunk
It's the freakin' weekend
Baby I'm about to have me some fun fun
It's the remix to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin'
Sippin' on coke and rum rum
I'm like so what I'm drunk drunk
It's the freakin' weekend
Baby I'm about to have me some fun fun
Girl we off in this Jeep
Foggin' windows up
Blastin' the radio
In the back of my truck
Bouncin' up and down
Strokin' round and round
To the remix
We just thuggin' it out
